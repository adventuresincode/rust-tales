# Rust Macros

This is as simple as '!'.
To execute a macro in RUST, use the command followed by '!'.  
This results in **meta-programming** or the macro generating other code which will be substituted at a later point before the code is executed.


Variables
RUST Is statically typed and will need to know the variable type at compile time.
```
let a:i64=10;
```
